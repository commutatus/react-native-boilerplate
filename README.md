__Usage__

After cloning and npm install please follow the steps below, later env file and variable names can be changed and this boilerplate is completely customizable.

#### Step 1 : Run command `rm -rf .git` this is basically to remove git from the project and the boilerplate can be reinitialized to required origin or repo.
#### Step 2 :Install `npm install react-native-rename -g` and run  `react-native-rename newName` this helps to rename build artifact and app name. more info check this [link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-rename).
#### Step 3 : Create `staging.env` and `prod.env` at `/env` folder.
#### Step 4 : run `./run.sh`  at root.
-  This is a custom script to select env and build type
-  We can also select env directly by running `./run.sh staging`
